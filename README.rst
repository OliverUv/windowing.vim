What it is
==========

This plugin contains convenience functions for working with vim windows.
It will not mess with your mappings, so you have to decide for yourself
how you want to map each of its functions. Each function has a suggested
mapping in the documentation file (doc/windowing.txt).


Functions
=========

Short description of each function. See doc/windowing.txt for details.

:windowing#minimize_vertically:
    Sets the vertical size of a window to the number of lines in its buffer.


Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome! Submit pull requests from feature branches
rebased onto the main repository's master branch. Short and descriptive
commit messages, please.
