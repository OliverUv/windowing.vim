INSTRUCTION                                     *windowing-instruction*

This plugin defines a number of convenience functions for working with several
windows. I don't want to mess with your mappings, so map them yourself!

Generally, mappings can be done in this form >
    nnoremap <silent> KEYSTOMAP :call g:FUNCTION_TO_MAP()<cr>
<

==============================================================================
MINIMIZE                                        *windowing-minimize*

Sets the vertical size of a window to the number of lines in its buffer.

Lets say you have a .html and its .css file open, with the CSS in a window
above the HTML file. Both start out covering 50% of your vertical screen real
estate, but since the CSS file is only 6 lines long, you want it to cover a
lot less so you have room to see your HTML. You put your cursor in the CSS
buffer and run this function: The CSS window is now 6 lines tall.

Suggested mapping: >
    nnoremap <silent> z<cr> :call windowing#minimize_vertically()<cr>
<
(NOTE will overwrite an existing mapping)
The mapping above fits well with the semantics of the zN<CR> mapping of :h z
As far as I can tell z<CR> is identical to zt but with the annoying side
effect of moving your cursor.
